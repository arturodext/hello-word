The hello-word begins
Arturo here, or Dexter, what you wish like.
I'm a developer of indie game. Actually I'm working on two:
The first one it's Zelda Clone.
The second it's a original story, as D&D, but multiple-choice.
I work on JAVAScript actually, with Eclipse IDE.
I would like to learn Python, Lua and LÃ–VE2D.

Would love to help the community :3
